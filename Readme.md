Pre-requisites
------

Performing the analysis requires `ebook-convert`, as well as a python 3
installation, the python3 `nltk` library and the SentiWordNet database
installed systemwide or into `~/nltk_data`.
The `pyenchant` Python library is also needed (specifically, the `en_US` dictionary).

For Arch users, the relevant packages can be installed via:
`# pacman -S ebook-convert python-nltk nltk-data python-pyenchant`.

You will also need to download the fimfiction dump and extract it to `res/fimfarchive-20160525`.
The fimfiction dumps can be found on JockeTF's
[website](http://jocketf.se/files/fimfarchive/), or in
