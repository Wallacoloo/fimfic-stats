Pre-requisites
------

Performing the analysis requires `ebook-convert`, as well as a python 3
installation.
You will also need to download the fimfiction dump and extract it to `res/fimfarchive-20160525`.
The fimfiction dumps can be found on JockeTF's
[website](http://jocketf.se/files/fimfarchive/), or in
[this]([https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/4l5o3p/fimfarchive_20160525_released_all_stories_on/)
reddit thread.
Lastly, download the word associativity data from
[SentiWordNed](http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/) and place the
`SentiWordNet_3.0.0_20130122.txt` file under `res/`.
If any of the file names differ (due to updated versions, etc), update
the corresponding path variables in the Makefile.
